    <h2>Market</h2>

    <p>The Market is the place to go for new units and buildings. You can buy them by spending your experience points.
        Once you bought an new item it will appear in the user interface in the game. <br/>
        <b>Please not:</b> it can be possible that you need different buildings and/or construction vehicle to
        be able to build some of the units you can buy in the market.</p>


    <b>There are different ways to get experience points</b>
    <ul>
        <li>You get experience points for every unit and building every 10 minutes. As long as your
            units and buildings are not destroyed, you get points for them
        </li>
        <li>Destroy units and buildings of other players</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Please note:</b> you continue to get points while you are not logged in to the game. You can come
        back to the game if you have a registered user. Please register <a href="" wicket:id="createAccountLink">here</a> if you don't have a user yet.</p>
