    <p>This is a real-time strategy game like C&C or starcraft but fully browser based. This means you don't need to
        install any software on your computer.</p>

    <p>The aim of the game is to build and defend your base whilst attacking the bases of other players using the
        vehicles produced by your base.</p>

    <p>It is a network game, where each player competes against all other human players. Note that your base continues
        to
        exist when you are logged
        out of the game, this means that other players can attack your base whilst you are logged out. If you log back
        into the game, you can
        continue to use your base if it has not been destroyed in your absence.</p>

    <p>You begin the game with a single construction vehicle which you should use to build a factory. Once you have
        built a factory
        you can then create vehicles such as attack vehicles, harvesters etc. Note that each vehicle and building costs
        a certain
        amount of resources. In order to collect resources, you must create harvesters and use it to harvest money from
        a resource mine.</p>
