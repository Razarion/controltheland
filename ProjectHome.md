The aim of the game is to build and defend your base whilst attacking the bases of other players using the vehicles produced by your base.

It is a network game, where each player competes against all other human players. Note that your base continues to exist when you are logged out of the game, this means that other players can attack your base whilst you are logged out. If you log back into the game, you can continue to use your base if it has not been destroyed in your absence.

You begin the game with a single construction vehicle which you should use to build a factory. Once you have built a factory you can then create vehicles such as attack vehicles, harvesters etc. Note that each vehicle and building costs a certain amount of resources. In order to collect resources, you must create harvesters and use it to harvest money from a resource mine.
